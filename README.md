> @chrisbonini @ChaseGiunta Disabling auto-away isn't on our immediate roadmap,
but it's on our "someday" list. Stay tuned! âœ¨

I do no twant to stay tuned.

Auto-away in slack is annoying, at least it is to me. That I've not lurked
around slack for 30 minutes does not mean I am not available for anyone to
ping. It baffles me such option is not available. Fortunately the slack API
allows for circumventing this "feature".

OS X and Windows slack dists have something that checks for activity
on the whole computer and disables auto-away. People using the webapp have no
such option, so there's this.
